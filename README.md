# frictionless-transforms
A scratch area for collaborating on Frictionless data transforms.

Initial design objective: 
  - A simple framework that allows a transformation to be applied to reshape a Frictionless data package. 
  - Attention to detail on documentation
  - Ability to use different transforms
  - Runable on "laptop scale" data (v1)
